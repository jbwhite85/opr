OPR/OSR - Online Product Registration / One Stop RMA  ---  NAME IS STILL TBD.

ACTUAL MVP will be only the OPR

For the user (needs to do):
	-Option A-On first start-up of app, have user into profile information (ie: name, address, email, phone, etc for 		common registration information) which will be saved for future registrations later on down the road (one-time 	thing)... or continue on and see option B
	-Scan barcode to bring up the product (or manually enter UPC)
	-Scan barcode for serial number, if unable (or no barcode for serial number), user will manually enter serial 			number, date of purchase, place of purchase
	-Option B- user will manually enter client's name, address, email address, etc (common registration info)
	-Press send.  Which will send the info to our server, which will in turn, send to the manufacturer to register 			their product


For the owner (needs to do):
	-Simple GUI of a one-button / one-click camera interface, if fails, revert to the manual input pages
	-Find out how apps like "Shop Saavy", or similar uses the camera of a smart phone to pull data from 'xyz' server to 	get the product information, and implement that concept to our service
	-Setup database server for all of the user's profiles/inputs/info to be sent and stored
	-Using the 'price per registration' method (manual labor to re-input the data to each manufaturer)[for now], send 		the info to the respective manufaturer within 1 hour of gathering the data
	-Send user a confirmation email that our server/service department has received their information and will hear 		from us shortly when the product was successfully registered.
